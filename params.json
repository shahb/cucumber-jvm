{"name":"Cucumber-jvm","body":"Cucumber-JVM is a pure Java implementation of Cucumber that supports the following programming languages:\r\n\r\n* Clojure\r\n* Groovy\r\n* Ioke\r\n* Java\r\n* JavaScript (Rhino interpreter)\r\n* Python (Jython interpreter)\r\n* Ruby (JRuby interpreter)\r\n* Scala\r\n\r\nCucumber-JVM provides the following mechanisms for running Cucumber Features:\r\n\r\n* Command Line\r\n* JUnit (via IDE, Maven, Ant or anything that knows how to run JUnit)\r\n\r\nCucumber-JVM also integrates with the following Dependency Injection containers:\r\n\r\n* Guice\r\n* PicoContainer\r\n* Spring\r\n* CDI/Weld\r\n\r\n## Downloading / Installation\r\n\r\nFinal releases will be published in [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/) when all issues in [Milestone 1](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/issues?milestone=1&state=open) are closed. Until then you can grab \r\nSNAPSHOT releases by adding this repo to your POM:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<repository>\r\n    <id>sonatype-snapshots</id>\r\n    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>\r\n</repository>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can grab jars with the following dependency in your POM:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>info.cukes</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>cucumber-core</artifactId>\r\n    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Maven you can download the SNAPSHOT jars manually from https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/info/cukes/\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nThere isn't any documentation yet apart from API docs. Documentation will be published when the first release candidate for 1.0.0 is ready.\r\nIf you are adventurous, check out the examples, read the code and ask specific questions on the Cucumber mailing list.\r\n\r\n### API Docs\r\n\r\n* http://cukes.info/cucumber/jvm/api/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/apidocs/ (URL subject to change)\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nYou will find an example in Git under examples/java-calculator. You should be able to run `basic_arithmetic.feature` by running the `cucumber.examples.java.calculator.basic_arithmetic_Test` JUnit test from your IDE. -Or simply by running it with Maven: `mvn clean install -P examples` once to build it all. Then `cd examples/java-calculator` followed by `mvn test` each time you make a change. Try to make the feature fail!\r\n\r\n## Hacking\r\n\r\nTo hack on Cucumber-JVM you need a JDK, Maven and Git to get the code. You also need to set your IDE/text editor to use:\r\n\r\n* UTF-8 file encoding\r\n* LF (UNIX) line endings\r\n* 4 Space indent (no tabs)\r\n  * Java\r\n  * XML\r\n* 2 Space indent (no tabs)\r\n  * Gherkin\r\n\r\nIf we get a pull request where an entire file is changed because of insignificant whitespace changes we cannot see what you have changed.\r\n\r\n### Building Cucumber-JVM\r\n\r\nYou'll need Maven to build the Java code (we're happily accepting patches for other build systems). To build and run tests, run:\r\n\r\n    mvn clean install\r\n\r\n### Continuous Integration\r\n\r\nhttp://jenkins-01.public.cifoundry.net/job/Cucumber%20JVM/\r\n\r\n### Running cross-platform Cucumber features\r\n\r\nAll Cucumber implementations (cucumber-ruby, cucumber-jvm, cucumber-js) share a common set of Cucumber features to ensure all implementations support the same basic features. To run these you need to clone the cucumber-features into your cucumber-jvm working copy:\r\n\r\n    git submodule update --init\r\n\r\nNow you can run the cross-platform Cucumber features:\r\n\r\n    gem install bundler\r\n    bundle install\r\n    rake\r\n\r\n### Code generation\r\n\r\nStepDefinition APIs in all of Gherkin's supported i18n languages are generated using Ruby. \r\nThe i18n Java annotations (except English) are not added to the Git repo because Git on both OS X and Windows handles UTF-8 file names badly.\r\nIn order to compile `cucumber-java` with all I18n annotations, you have to generate them yourself.\r\nWith Ruby installed and on your path, install some gems that are needed for code generation:\r\n\r\n#### Using bundler\r\n\r\nTry this first\r\n\r\n    gem install bundler\r\n    bundle install\r\n\r\nNow you can generate the code:\r\n\r\n    rake generate\r\n\r\n#### Without bundler\r\n\r\nOn Windows it might be tricky to install all the gems. (The listed gems are used for both code generation and for running the cross-platform features). If you only want to generate code, you can get away with:\r\n\r\n    gem install gherkin\r\n    rake generate SKIP_BUNDLER=true\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nBelow are some common problems you might encounter while hacking on Cucumber-JVM - and solutions.\r\n\r\n### IntelliJ Idea fails to compile the generated I18n Java annotations\r\n\r\nThis can be solved by changing the Compiler settings: `Preferences -> Compiler -> Java Compiler`:\r\n\r\n* *Use compiler:* `Javac in-process (Java6+ only)`\r\n* *Additional command line parameters:* `-target 1.6 -source 1.6 -encoding UTF-8`\r\n\r\n## Contributing fixes\r\n\r\nFork the repository on Github, clone it and send a pull request when you have fixed something. Please commit each feature/bugfix on a separate branch as this makes it easier for us to decide what to merge and what not to merge.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Cucumber for the JVM (successor of Cuke4Duke)","google":"UA-32379155-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
